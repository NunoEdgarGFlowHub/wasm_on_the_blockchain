- Better understand the challenges, opportunities and requirements for modern blockchain smart contracts execution
- Explore dev toolchains and workflows for coding, debugging and deploying executable code
- Spark collaboration on common cross-project VM and dev workflows specs
- Share learnings and resources between projects

## TARGET AUDIENCE
Technical people working on blockchain smart contracts projects or on WASM runtimes, compilers and dev tools.
